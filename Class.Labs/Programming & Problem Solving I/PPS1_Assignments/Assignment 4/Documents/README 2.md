A little game I made in 8 hours for a project that didn't require much. But I wanted to try to exceed my personal expectations because I wanted to prove to myself that I can program after I'm preeeety sure i failed my exam. enjoy. Crazy how this started off as a green box, a white background, and a red square lol
