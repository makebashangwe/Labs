''' Repetition Statements (while loops, for loops, break, continue)
Question:
Create a Python function print_even_numbers(n) that:

Prints even numbers from 0 up to, but not including, a given positive integer n.
Use a while loop in this function, and add a for loop version afterward.
Follow-Up: Try testing both with n = 10. Consider using break or continue if you think theyâ€™d make the loop clearer.
