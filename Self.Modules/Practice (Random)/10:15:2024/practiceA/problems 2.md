Symbol Practice with For Loops
1. Triangle of Asterisks
Write a program that prints a triangle of asterisks (*). The number of rows should be determined by user input.

Example: If the user enters 5, it should print:

*
**
***
****
*****

2. Reverse Triangle of Numbers
Create a program that prints a reverse triangle with numbers, where the number of rows is determined by user input.

Example: If the user enters 4, it should print:

Copy code
1 1 1 1
2 2 2
3 3
4
3. Diamond Pattern
Write a program that prints a diamond shape using asterisks (*). The number of rows for the top half should be based on user input.

Example: If the user enters 3, it should print:

markdown
Copy code
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
Array Practice
4. Sum of Elements in an Array
Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of the elements.

Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 15

5. Find the Maximum Element
Create a function that takes an array of integers and returns the maximum value.

Example: Input: [3, 5, 7, 2, 8, -1]
Output: 8

6. Check If an Element Exists in an Array
Write a function that checks whether a given element exists in an array. Return True if it exists, otherwise False.

Example: Input: array = [10, 20, 30, 40], element = 30
Output: True

Dictionary Practice
7. Count Occurrences of Words in a String
Write a program that takes a string and counts how many times each word appears in the string. The program should return a dictionary where the keys are words, and the values are the counts.

Example: Input: "apple banana apple cherry banana apple"
Output: {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 1}

Pygame Practice
8. Move a Block Left or Right
In Pygame, create a small square that can be moved left and right on the screen using the arrow keys.

The square should start at the center of the screen.
When the left arrow is pressed, the square should move left.
When the right arrow is pressed, the square should move right.
The square should stop at the screen boundaries.
